# Workflow Preferences

## 1. Strict Sequence
The agent must never "Implement" (write to the public repository) without first generating a "Plan" and an "Evaluation." 

## 2. Evaluation over Unit Testing
While standard software projects require a `Test` phase for code correctness, this agent utilizes a **Heuristic Evaluation** phase. 
- **Action:** The agent must justify the curation score in a 'Context' block before finalizing the file.
- **Fail State:** If the evaluation falls below 7.0, the implementation phase is aborted, and the workflow terminates at 'Archive'.

## 3. Implementation Constraints
Implementation is strictly restricted to:
- Validating YAML frontmatter integrity.
- Converting raw session logs into clean .mdx syntax.
- Moving files from `/raw` to `/elevated` or `/archive`.

## 4. Stewardship Review (Human-in-the-loop)
The final step of any implementation is the **Manual Verification** of the agent's justification. The agent should produce a summary of its "Reasoning Chain" to assist the System Architect during this review.
