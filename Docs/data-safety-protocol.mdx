# Data & Safety

## 1. Data Handling Scope
- **Handled:** Markdown inscriptions, JSON session logs, system architecture drafts.
- **Prohibited:** Authentication keys, passwords, personal identifiers, or financial data. 
- **Constraint:** If the agent detects a string matching a high-entropy secret (API keys), it must immediately flag the file and halt the elevation process.

## 2. Privacy Guarantees
- **Inference Privacy:** External API calls are limited to the content of the artifact. No user system metadata is shared.
- **Data Sovereignty:** The primary "Source of Truth" is the local file system. 
- **Encryption:** Any data in transit to the evaluation model must be encrypted via standard TLS protocols.

## 3. Safety Guardrails
- **The "Vault" Principle:** The agent is only authorized to read from `/raw` and write to `/elevated` or `/archive`. It is strictly prohibited from accessing the `.git` directory, root system files, or the user's home directory.
- **Scrubbing:** During the "Refinement" phase, the agent should proactively scrub any ephemeral system noise (like the MCP connection errors) to ensure only clean intellectual content is promoted.

## 4. Permission Model
- **Implicit:** Archiving of low-score artifacts.
- **Explicit:** Elevation to the public sanctuary requires a manual verification of the `Stewardship Review` justification.
