# Architecture Vision

## 1. Primary Pattern
- **Pattern:** Event-Driven Pipeline.
- **Trigger:** File creation in `/raw` directory.
- **Logic:** Pipeline-based transformation (Cleanse → Evaluate → Inscribe → Elevate).

## 2. Deployment Strategy
- **Nature:** Local-first Hybrid.
- **Rationale:** Sensitive raw session logs must remain local until elevated. Only the prompt/log content is sent to the Cloud-based Models for processing.

## 3. Component Definition
- **Orchestrator:** The Python-based 'Steward' service.
- **Evaluation Layer:** The 10-point Rubric Engine.
- **Memory Layer:** - *Short-term:* Session-specific context.
  - *Long-term:* Repository-wide tagging and cross-reference logic.
- **Action Engine:** File system operations (move/write) and metadata injection.

## 4. Growth Direction
- **Phase 1:** (Current) Sequential processing of single logs.
- **Phase 2:** Multi-agent collaboration where one agent scores and another "Refines" the pedagogical clarity of the .mdx.
- **Phase 3:** Full Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration for deeper tool access.
