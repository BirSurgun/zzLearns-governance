# Architectural Constraints

## 1. Structural Pattern: Modular
The system is composed of independent modules (Watcher, Evaluator, Inscriber). This allows the LLM to update the "Scoring Rubric" without touching the "File System Logic."

## 2. Data Flow: Unidirectional
Data moves strictly from `/raw` -> `Evaluation` -> `/elevated` or `/archive`. 
* **Constraint:** No process may write back into the `/raw` directory once a file is picked up.

## 3. Tooling Constraints
- **Runtime:** Python 3.9+ (Server-side service).
- **Communication:** Stateless API calls to Gemini 2.0.
- **Persistence:** Local file system acting as a state machine via directory movement.

## 4. Operational Integrity
The agent must maintain "Quiet Architectural Authority." It is forbidden from adding conversational filler to the .mdx outputs. The output must be the artifact and nothing else.
