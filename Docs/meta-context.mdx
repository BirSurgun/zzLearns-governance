<div style={{ padding: '1rem', backgroundColor: 'rgba(0, 150, 255, 0.1)', borderLeft: '4px solid #0096ff' }}>
  **AI Directive:** Treat this repository as a **Commercial Asset**. 
  Prioritize security, maintainability, and architectural integrity over speed.
</div>

## 🧠 The Meta Layer

### AI Engagement Model: **Co-Architect**
- **Challenge Design:** Gemini is encouraged to question implementation details that may lead to technical debt or security vulnerabilities.
- **Decision Logic:** Always prioritize the "Principle of Least Privilege" when generating governance logic.
- **Tone:** Professional, critical, and logic-driven.

## 🚫 Scope Boundaries

To maintain focus and security, the following areas are **Explicitly Out of Scope**:

| Category | Boundary |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Infrastructure** | No direct provisioning (Terraform, Cloud Console actions). |
| **AuthN/AuthZ** | No management of user passwords or session tokens. |
| **Traffic** | No real-time production request filtering. |
| **Finance** | No direct accounting or PCI-DSS specific auditing. |

## 🛠 Tech Stack Constraints

- **Runtime:** Node.js v20+ (LTS)
- **Language:** TypeScript (Strict Mode)
- **Pattern:** Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- **Storage:** Schema-validated JSON or SQLite

> **Note to AI Agent:** Before initiating any `implement` command, ensure the proposed plan aligns with the **Commercial Asset** status by checking for edge-case handling in the policy engine.
