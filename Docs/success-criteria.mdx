# Success Criteria

## 1. Technical Performance
- **Target Latency:** Processing from `/raw` to `.mdx` draft in < 15 seconds.
- **Accuracy:** > 90% alignment with manual scoring during the "Stewardship Review."
- **Reliability:** 100% adherence to the YAML frontmatter schema.

## 2. Qualitative Benchmarks
- **Signal-to-Noise:** The public sanctuary contains zero ephemeral system logs.
- **Tone Adherence:** Every elevated file maintains a "Quiet Architectural Authority."
- **Justification Depth:** Reasoning blocks must cite specific elements of the artifact to justify the score.

## 3. Human Impact
- **Friction Reduction:** Elimination of manual Markdown formatting for session logs.
- **Cognitive Load:** The architect spends < 2 minutes per day on "Elevation" approvals.
