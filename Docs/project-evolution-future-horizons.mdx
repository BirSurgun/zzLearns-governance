# Context
As the **zzLearns-governance** framework moves from a foundational curation agent to a persistent stewardship service, it is necessary to project its trajectory. This document outlines the long-term evolution of the system, transforming from a localized tool into a comprehensive intellectual infrastructure.

# Goal
The goal is to define the two-year evolutionary path for the Curation Agent, shifting from reactive document management to a proactive, multi-agent ecosystem that serves as a cornerstone for personal and systemic research.

# Success Criteria: 2-Year Horizon
The evolution will be measured by the system's ability to transition into a **Personal Research Infrastructure** that operates with the sophistication of a localized **AI Operating System**.

### 1. The Personal Research Infrastructure (Months 12-18)
- **Recursive Knowledge Synthesis:** The agent no longer just curates single logs but identifies "emergent patterns" across hundreds of artifacts to suggest new "Master Inscriptions".
- **Cross-Domain Intelligence:** The agent integrates with external data streams (e.g., academic journals, technical repositories) to ground raw session logs in broader global contexts.

### 2. The Open Source Governance Framework (Month 24)
- **Productization through Open Source:** The core logic is abstracted into a plug-and-play framework for other "Digital Sanctuaries," allowing anyone to deploy a local-first stewardship service with their own custom scoring rubrics.
- **Protocol Standardization:** zzLearns-governance becomes a reference implementation for **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** stewardship, defining how agents should securely manage private intellectual property.

# Implementation Flow
1. **Foundation:** Automated directory monitoring and rubric-based elevation.
2. **Expansion:** Multi-agent collaboration (Scorer, Refiner, and Archivist agents).
3. **Integration:** Full adoption as a **Internal Productivity Engine** where the agent proactively identifies areas of "Intellectual Debt" within the repository.

# Outcome
In two years, the system will have evolved from a "filter" into an **Autonomous Intellectual Steward**. It will not only preserve the past but actively facilitate the "descent" into future work, ensuring the Digital Sanctuary remains a living, breathing archive of deep thought rather than a static repository.
