# Goal
The establishment of a Curation Agent ensures that the digital sanctuary is maintained with architectural integrity. This agent acts as a deliberate filter between raw intellectual artifacts and the public archive, ensuring that only inscriptions reflecting depth, intentionality, and systemic value are elevated for sharing.

# Scoring Rubric
Artifacts are evaluated on a 10-point scale. A minimum score of 7 is required for promotion from the internal repository to the public sanctuary.

| Pillar | Criteria | Weight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Coherence | Alignment with the values of care, quietude, and stewardship. | 30% |
| Depth | Presence of reflective inquiry or complex reasoning chains. | 25% |
| Utility | Long-term functional durability and systemic value. | 25% |
| Pedagogy | Ability to communicate the craft or "the descent" to others. | 20% |



# Implementation Plan
The workflow is designed to prevent context loss while maintaining a high barrier for public entry.

1. **Raw Inscription:** Manual placement of session logs or prompts into the `/raw` directory of the `zzLearns-governance` repository.
2. **Agent Evaluation:** The Curation Agent scans the specified directory and applies the weighted rubric to each entry.
3. **Draft Generation:** Prompts achieving a score of 7 or higher are automatically structured into .mdx inscriptions with complete metadata.
4. **Stewardship Review:** Manual verification of the agent's justification and output to ensure the "North Star" goal remains intact.
5. **Elevation:** Movement of validated files to the public repository at `BirSurgun/zz`.



# Curation Agent Blueprint
The following instruction set defines the operational logic for the agent during a curation cycle.

```text
Role: Curation Steward for the zzLearns-governance repository.

Operational Logic:
1. Scan the /raw folder for intellectual artifacts and session logs.
2. Apply the weighted scoring rubric: Coherence (30%), Depth (25%), Utility (25%), Pedagogy (20%).
3. Generate formal .mdx inscriptions for any prompt scoring 7 or higher.
4. Populate the YAML frontmatter with title, date, type, status, and relevant tags.
5. Include the specific numerical score and a brief architectural justification in the 'Context' section.

Constraints:
- Strictly avoid all emoticons and informal language.
- Maintain a tone of quiet architectural authority.
- Do not access clipboard data; operate only on provided files.
