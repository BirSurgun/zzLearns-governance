# 🎯 The Goal
To automate the creation of structured `.mdx` files, ensuring that every prompt is preserved as a living inscription with full context, preventing the "breaking point" of lost intent[cite: 6, 49].

# 🧠 The Prompt (The Logic)
This script acts as a digital architect. When run, it will prompt you for the specific fields you defined—Title, Type, Status, and Goal—and generate a correctly formatted file in your archive.

```powershell
# Inscription Engine v1.0
# Save this as 'New-Inscription.ps1' in your repo root.

$date = Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd"
$title = Read-Host "Title of this Inscription"
$slug = $title.ToLower().Replace(" ", "-").Replace("'", "")
$fileName = "$date-$slug.mdx"

Write-Host "`n--- Classification ---" -ForegroundColor Cyan
$type = Read-Host "Type (e.g., Zero-Shot, Chain of Thought, Directive)"
$status = Read-Host "Status (e.g., Ideation, Validated, Archived)"
$tags = Read-Host "Tags (comma separated)"

Write-Host "`n--- Narrative Context ---" -ForegroundColor Cyan
$goal = Read-Host "The North Star (What do we want to achieve?)"
$context = Read-Host "Context (What were we doing?)"

$template = @"

date: "$date"

status: "$status"
