### 2. Automating the Creation (VS Code Snippet)
Since you work on Windows in VS Code, you can automate this so you don't have to type it every time.
1. In VS Code, go to **File > Share > User Snippets**.
2. Select **mdx**.
3. Paste this configuration:
```json
{
  "New Prompt Archive": {
    "prefix": "newprompt",
    "body": [
      "---",
      "title: \"${1:Title}\"",
      "date: \"${CURRENT_YEAR}-${CURRENT_MONTH}-${CURRENT_DATE}\"",
      "author: \"Your Name\"",
      "type: \"Prompt\"",
      "status: \"Archive\"",
      "tags:",
      "  - ${2:Philosophy}",
      "---",
      "",
      "# The Goal",
      "${3:What was the intent?}",
      "",
      "# The Prompt",
      "```text",
      "${4:Paste prompt here}",
      "```",
      "",
      "# Outcome & Context",
      "- **Result:** ${5:Success/Failure}",
      "- **Notes:** ${6:Observations}"
    ],
    "description": "Create a structured prompt archive file"
  }
}
