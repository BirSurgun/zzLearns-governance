# Context
The session involves the architectural transition from a conceptual **Curation Agent Framework** to a functional, automated system. The user is establishing a digital sanctuary—a curated public archive—that requires a gatekeeping mechanism to filter raw session logs and intellectual artifacts. The dialogue focused on defining the operational logic and technical deployment of a server-side or local agent capable of autonomous evaluation based on a specific 10-point weighted rubric.

# Goal
The primary objective is to implement a local or server-side **Curation Steward** service. This service must monitor a `/raw` directory, evaluate incoming JSON session logs against the "Governance and Stewardship Framework," and automatically promote high-value content (score ≥ 7) to a public repository (`BirSurgun/zz`) while maintaining architectural integrity and a quiet, authoritative tone.

# Prompt to Realize the Goal
To move from blueprint to implementation, the following operational prompt was developed for the agent:

```text
Role: Curation Steward for the zzLearns-governance repository.

Operational Logic:
1. Scan the /raw folder for intellectual artifacts and session logs.
2. Filter for user and assistant messages, disregarding system noise or errors.
3. Identify:
   - What is the goal?
   - What would be the complete prompt?
   - What is the outcome?
4. Apply the weighted scoring rubric: Coherence (30%), Depth (25%), Utility (25%), Pedagogy (20%).
5. Generate formal .mdx inscriptions for any prompt scoring 7 or higher.
6. Populate YAML frontmatter and include a brief architectural justification in the 'Context' section.

Constraints:
- Strictly avoid all emoticons and informal language.
- Maintain a tone of quiet architectural authority.

Outcome:
 - Technical Blueprint: A Python-based service utilizing watchdog and google-genai was drafted to automate the curation cycle.
 - Rubric Calibration: Benchmark scoring criteria (Low/Moderate/High) were established for each of the four pillars.
 - Standardized Output: A template for .mdx inscriptions was finalized, ensuring consistent metadata and "Architectural Justification" for all elevated artifacts.
 - Operational Readiness: The system is prepared for deployment as a persistent service (systemd or Docker) to eliminate the burden of manual documentation.
